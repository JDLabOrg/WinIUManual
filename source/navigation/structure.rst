Structure is a panel that shows the structure of elements (sections, headers, footers, page contents, widgets, etc.) that belong to the currently selected page in tree form.
You can delete elements, move them to drag and drops, or add new sections.
You can also change the structure of this panel or modify the names of the added elements to the name you want.
